# Weather App with Pokémon Card UI

This Weather App provides real-time weather information using a Weather API and Timezone API. The app displays weather details in the form of a Pokémon card style, making it visually engaging and interactive. Users can enter the name of a city, and the app will fetch weather data such as temperature, humidity, and short description of weather. 

Key features:
 * Dynamic Weather Information: Fetches and displays real-time weather details for any given city.
 * Day/Night Mode: The app checks the time zone of the city using the Timezone API and adjusts the appearance of the weather card accordingly. During the day, the card is styled in warm, vibrant colors (orange), and at night, it switches to a cooler, dark theme (black).
